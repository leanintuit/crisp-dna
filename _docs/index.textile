h1. What is this?

This site is an "open-source":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source site describing how Leanintuit works and why.

"Leanintuit":http://www.leanintuit.com is a consulting company based in Toronto, Ontario.

By working together, and continuously experimenting with the way the company works, we figured out what works for us.

At some point Leanintuit grew to the point that we felt we needed to write down the way we worked. Right around that time we found out that "Crisp":https://www.crisp.se had open-sourced their company's "DNA" and it was an great match for the way we were working.
We decided to fork their "Github":https://github.com/crispab/crisp-dna project and use it as the base for our own DNA.
